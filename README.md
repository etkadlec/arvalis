# R Software for creating maps of abundances of ticks across the territory of the Czech Republic
This is a result of a project funded by the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic (grant no. AZV 16-33934A). Here you can find programming code (file "maps.R") creating disease risk maps. These may be either maps of tick abundances or maps of pathogen prevalence. Data can be found in "data.txt". Shapefiles for the Czech Republic are in "cr.zip", "okresy.zip" and "toky.zip". Large cities are stored in "mesta.txt". Zip files need to be extracted to your folder where you store maps, e.g. D://maps.
